#DESIGN PATTERNS

###Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

##Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Factory Method**

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Abstract Factory**

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Builder**

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- **Prototype**

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

- **Singleton**

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
